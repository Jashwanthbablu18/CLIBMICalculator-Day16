# 🏋️‍♂️ Day 16 - BMI Calculator with Nested Functions

Welcome to **Day 16** of my **#30DaysOfPythonChallenge**!  
Today’s focus was on **nested functions** for modular and structured code.

---

## 📌 Topic
**Nested Functions in Python** — defining a function inside another for scoped logic encapsulation.

---

## 🧠 What I Built

A CLI-based **BMI Calculator** that:
- Takes user input for weight (kg) and height (m)
- Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Uses a **nested function** to classify the result:
  - Underweight: BMI < 18.5  
  - Normal: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9  
  - Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9  
  - Obese: BMI ≥ 30

## 🚀 Concepts Practiced

- Nested functions for scoped logic
- BMI formula: `weight / (height ** 2)`
- Clean and interactive CLI output
- Input validation and conditional classification

## 💻 How to Run

```bash
python Day-16Code.py
